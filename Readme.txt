# 🎓 Tutor Management System (TMS)

## 📌 Project Description

Tutor Management System (TMS) is a web-based EdTech platform developed to connect students with tutors in a simple
and structured way. The system allows students to view tutors, send tutoring requests, and track their request
status, while tutors can manage incoming requests, respond to students, and share contact information.

This project is built using **ASP.NET Web Forms** and **SQL Server**, focusing on role-based access, real-world
workflow, and clean UI design. It is suitable as an academic project, learning reference, and interview showcase.
